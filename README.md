# VELOCITY — Car Velocity Analysis

## Description
The theme of this project is a high-performance automotive dashboard and landing page. It focuses on "Velocity Metrics," providing a digital interface to monitor acceleration, aerodynamics, and real-time telemetry. The design uses a luxury dark aesthetic to represent the speed and precision of modern supercar engineering.

## Features
* **Velocity Metrics Grid:** A responsive display for tracking acceleration deltas and torque curves.
* **Responsive Navigation:** A sticky glassmorphism menu that adapts for mobile and desktop viewing.
* **Manufacturer Integration:** A dedicated section showcasing partnerships with brands like Ferrari, Porsche, and Bugatti.
* **Performance Timeline:** A step-by-step technical guide on analyzing velocity curves and tuning vehicle launch logic.
* **Atmospheric Visuals:** Custom gradient backgrounds and lighting effects that enhance content visibility in dark mode.

## Technical Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for high-performance content delivery.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first framework used for the custom "Dark Luxury" theme and mobile-first responsiveness.
* **Glassmorphism UI:** Implementation of backdrop-filter and transparency for a futuristic dashboard feel.
* **SVG Graphics:** Scalable vector graphics for manufacturer logos to ensure crispness on all screen sizes.

## Design Methodology
* **Mobile-First Approach:** The layout is engineered to stack telemetry data vertically on mobile devices (`grid-cols-1`) and expand to a cinematic wide-view on desktop (`md:grid-cols-3`).
* **Visual Depth:** Layered background gradients (`zinc-950` to `black`) prevent "black crushing" and ensure the UI borders remain visible and sharp.
